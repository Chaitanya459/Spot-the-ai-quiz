        "question": "Describe how you‚Äôve differentiated instruction for a mixed-ability classroom. What approach did you use, and how did students respond?",
        "a": "Differentiated instruction is a pedagogical method that involves adapting content, process, product, and learning environment to address individual student needs and preferences.",
        "b": "In my student teaching practicum, I grouped students based on pre-assessment scores and offered tiered reading assignments. High-readiness students tackled analytical texts while struggling readers used visual summaries. Most students reported feeling more confident during the reading workshop.",
        "ai": "a"
      },
      {
        "topic": "Assessment Design",
        "question": "How do you ensure your assessments measure student learning effectively?",
        "a": "Effective assessment design involves aligning tasks with learning outcomes and ensuring reliability and validity. Formative assessments are used to monitor progress while summative assessments evaluate mastery.",
        "b": "When I designed a social studies quiz, I included a mix of map-based questions and short reflections. This way, visual learners could show their understanding spatially while others could explain their reasoning in writing. I also piloted it with a peer to check clarity.",
        "ai": "a"
      },
      {
        "topic": "Classroom Technology Use",
        "question": "Share how you‚Äôve used educational technology to enhance student learning.",
        "a": "In my literacy methods course, I used Flipgrid to facilitate peer book reviews. Students recorded video responses, which encouraged oral expression and built a sense of classroom community.",
        "b": "Educational technology tools like Flipgrid and Kahoot can enhance student engagement and collaboration. They offer multimodal learning opportunities and immediate feedback for teachers.",
        "ai": "b"
      },
      {
        "topic": "Behavior Management",
        "question": "Describe a time when you addressed a behavioral challenge. What was the outcome?",
        "a": "Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) frameworks suggest reinforcing desired behaviors through structured systems of recognition and reteaching expectations.",
        "b": "During my practicum, one student consistently interrupted lessons. I implemented a behavior chart with specific goals and gave positive feedback at the end of each lesson. Within two weeks, disruptions decreased, and the student started taking ownership of their behavior.",
        "ai": "a"
      },
      {
        "topic": "Lesson Planning",
        "question": "How do you plan lessons that meet standards and engage students?",
        "a": "In a recent science unit on ecosystems, I used the 5E model‚Äîengage, explore, explain, elaborate, evaluate. Students built food webs using string, then created explainer videos summarizing their learning. The standard alignment was visible in the final rubric assessments.",
        "b": "Lesson planning requires alignment with curriculum standards, student engagement strategies, and assessment checkpoints to ensure learning objectives are met.",
        "ai": "b"
